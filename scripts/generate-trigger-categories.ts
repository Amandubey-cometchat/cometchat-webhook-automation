/**
 * Generates receiver/public/trigger-categories.json from
 * src/registry/webhook.registry.ts (the single source of truth), so the
 * dashboard can group live webhook events and show per-category coverage
 * without duplicating the registry data by hand.
 *
 * The receiver is a separate, plain-JS deployed service with no access to
 * this project's TypeScript registry at runtime — this script bridges that
 * gap by producing a static asset committed alongside it. Re-run whenever
 * a webhook is added to/removed from the registry:
 *   npx tsx scripts/generate-trigger-categories.ts
 *
 * Two separate structures, deliberately not one flat map — they answer
 * different questions:
 *
 *   triggerToCategory: which category does a LIVE EVENT belong in, keyed by
 *     the real trigger name CometChat sends. Legacy shares 2 trigger names
 *     with the modern MESSAGE category (message_delivery_receipt,
 *     message_read_receipt — see legacy.registry.ts) and a raw payload has
 *     no field saying which system sent it, so this is first-write-wins:
 *     REGISTRY's category order puts MESSAGE before LEGACY, so those 2
 *     names keep grouping under Message (the far more common, automated
 *     case) for live events. This is a real, inherent limitation — not a
 *     bug — for exactly those 2 trigger names.
 *
 *   categoryTotals: how many webhooks are REGISTERED in each category,
 *     counted directly from the registry with no collision resolution.
 *     Legacy is 5 here even though only 3 of its names are uniquely
 *     identifiable in a live event — the "registered" count and the
 *     "can this live event be unambiguously attributed" question are
 *     answered separately on purpose.
