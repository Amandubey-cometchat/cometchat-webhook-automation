# CometChat Webhook Automation

Real end-to-end QA automation for CometChat's Webhooks: trigger events via
the CometChat REST API and JS SDK (no UI needed), capture them on a small
Express receiver, and assert deeply on the payload with Playwright Test. No
mocks — every test run hits a real CometChat app and asserts on a real
webhook delivery.

## Architecture

```
webhook-automation/
  src/
    config/
      env.ts               -> resolves APP_ENV, loads .env.<APP_ENV>, prints the banner, blocks unconfirmed prod runs
      prod.config.ts        -> prod policy (valid regions, confirmation gate) — never secrets
      staging.config.ts     -> staging policy
      config.schema.ts       -> the typed EnvironmentConfig shape + runtime validation
    clients/                -> raw API access, nothing else
      cometchat.client.ts   -> low-level REST wrapper (base URL, headers, auth tokens)
      users.client.ts / groups.client.ts / messages.client.ts
      sdk.client.ts         -> real CometChat JS SDK session in a Playwright browser (WebSocket-only triggers)
      moderation.client.ts  -> probe-message senders for moderation testing
      calls.client.ts / meetings.client.ts / campaigns.client.ts -> NotImplementedError stubs (see Known limitations)
    webhook/                -> the "listener" layer — a test-side client for the deployed receiver
      webhook.listener.ts   -> public facade tests import (re-exports everything below)
      webhook.store.ts      -> reset/fetch events from the receiver
      webhook.waiter.ts     -> expectWebhookEvent / expectSingleWebhookEvent / assertNoWebhookEvent (poll, never fixed sleep)
      webhook.matcher.ts    -> reusable correlation-ID matcher factories
      webhook.correlation.ts -> typed correlation-ID vocabulary (messageId/groupId/userId/...)
      webhook.retry.ts      -> duplicate-delivery detection (settle-window watching)
    registry/                -> single source of truth for every webhook (see below)
    validators/               -> payload assertions, one file per category, extracted out of test bodies
    triggers/                 -> the action that produces a webhook, one file per category (orchestrates clients)
    data/factories/           -> test data generation (fixed users, unique guids/message text)
    utils/                    -> logger, generic retry/poll, timeout budgets, id-generator, cleanup registry
    tests/                    -> one spec file per webhook for GROUP/MESSAGE/USER; category files for
                                  calls/meetings/campaign/moderation (documented gaps); _shared/ for
                                  cross-cutting suites (duplicate-delivery, negative cases, edge cases,
                                  webhook-configuration CRUD)
  schemas/                    -> JSON Schema for the 3 automated categories (group/message/user) —
                                  see "Webhook coverage registry & report"
  scripts/
    setup.ts                 -> creates qa-user-1/qa-user-2 on the target environment
    cleanup.ts                -> sweeps stray "qa-" groups left by a crashed run
    register-webhooks.ts      -> webhook CRUD via CometChat's Management API (see Known limitations)
    upload-test-results.ts    -> pushes a local test run's results to the deployed receiver
    generate-coverage.ts       -> registry × latest run -> reports/coverage/webhook-coverage.{json,md}
  receiver/                   -> Express service CometChat delivers webhooks to (deployed on Render — see Step 1)
    index.js                 -> POST /webhook, event storage, /dashboard, /test-results
    public/dashboard.html    -> visual inspector: raw events + pass/fail/skip test results
  reports/
    html/                    -> Playwright's own HTML report (generated, gitignored)
    json/                    -> Playwright's JSON report + the run-provenance marker (generated, gitignored)
    coverage/                -> webhook-coverage.{json,md} — the real deliverable, committed
  playwright.config.ts
  tsconfig.json
  package.json
  .env.example
```

**Why this shape**: every functional requirement (env separation, a webhook
registry as single source of truth, real-payload validation, correlation-ID
based waiting, a coverage report) maps to one clearly-responsible layer, and
one shared spec suite runs against whichever environment `APP_ENV` selects —
never a `tests/prod/` vs `tests/staging/` duplication. Two deliberate
deviations from a fully literal per-webhook trigger-file layout: triggers are
grouped one file per category (not one file per action) since most actions
are 1-2 line wrappers around a client call — a separate file per action would
be pure pass-through noise; and `schemas/` only covers the 3 categories with
real, live-captured payloads (group/message/user) — inventing a schema for a
payload shape nobody has ever seen would violate "don't assume payload
fields" (see `src/validators/moderation.validator.ts` etc. for the categories
still pending a real payload).

## Step 0 — Prerequisites

1. A **dedicated CometChat app** per environment (Dashboard → Create App).
2. From that app: **App ID**, **Region**, **REST API Key** (fullAccess scope).
3. A public HTTPS URL for the receiver — a permanent deployment is strongly
   preferred over a local tunnel (see "Receiver hosting" below).
4. Node.js 18+.

## Step 1 — Deploy (or run) the receiver

**Permanent (recommended)**: deploy `receiver/` as its own Web Service on
Render (or Fly/Railway) — root directory `receiver`, build command
`npm install`, start command `npm start`, env vars `BASIC_AUTH_USER` /
`BASIC_AUTH_PASS`. Render assigns a stable URL automatically.

**Local dev alternative**: run it on your machine and expose it with a
tunnel — note the tunnel URL changes every restart, so you'll be re-pasting
it into both `.env.<name>` and the CometChat Dashboard often:

```bash
cd receiver
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # set BASIC_AUTH_USER / BASIC_AUTH_PASS
npm start                 # listens on :4001
```

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:4001   # or: ngrok http 4001
```

## Step 2 — Configure the webhook

CometChat's per-app REST API key (`COMETCHAT_REST_API_KEY`) **cannot** create
or edit webhooks — that requires a separate Multi-Tenancy Management API key
that only CometChat Sales provisions (see "Known limitations"). Until you
have one, configure the webhook by hand:

1. CometChat Dashboard → your app → Webhooks
2. Add your receiver's URL + `/webhook`, enable Basic Auth with the same
   `BASIC_AUTH_USER`/`BASIC_AUTH_PASS` as `receiver/.env`
3. Enable every individual trigger you want covered — this is a
   **per-trigger** checklist under each category tab (Message/User/Group/etc.),
   not just one toggle per category. It's easy to have a category "on" with
   specific triggers inside it still unchecked.

## Step 3 — Run the tests

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.staging-us   # fill in COMETCHAT_APP_ID, COMETCHAT_REGION,
                                   # COMETCHAT_REST_API_KEY, WEBHOOK_RECEIVER_URL,
                                   # RECEIVER_QUERY_URL — see "Multiple environments"
npm run setup                     # creates qa-user-1 / qa-user-2 on that app
npm run test:staging
```

Environment-specific entry points (each loads only that environment's
`.env.<name>` — see "Multiple environments" below):

```bash
npm run test:staging      # APP_ENV=staging-us, no confirmation needed
npm run test:prod:eu      # APP_ENV=prod-eu,  requires the confirmation baked into the script
npm run test:prod:us      # APP_ENV=prod-us,  same
npm run test:prod:in      # APP_ENV=prod-in,  same
```

Every one of these runs the full suite serially against that real CometChat
app (parallel runs would race on the receiver's shared event store — see
`playwright.config.ts`), then regenerates `reports/coverage/webhook-coverage.{json,md}`
for that environment. `npm run test:webhooks` additionally uploads results to
the deployed receiver so its dashboard's Test Results tab reflects them (see
"Receiver hosting").

Useful variants:
- `npm run test:staging -- --grep group` / `npm run test:prod:eu -- --grep message` —
  just one category (Playwright's own `--grep`, passed through)
- `npm run test:prod:eu -- --grep message_sent` — just one webhook
- `npx playwright test src/tests/message/message-sent.spec.ts` — just one spec file
  (loads `APP_ENV` from your shell — export it first, or prefix the command)
- `npx playwright show-report reports/html` — HTML report after a run
- `npm run coverage` — regenerate the coverage report from the last run without re-running anything
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` across the whole project
- `npm run cleanup` — sweep any stray `qa-*` groups left by a crashed run

## Step 4 — Watch it live

```
<your receiver URL>/dashboard
```

Two tabs:
- **Webhook Events** — every raw payload CometChat has ever delivered, grouped
  by trigger, persisted in `receiver/data/events-history.json` across restarts
- **Test Results** — the last uploaded test run's pass/fail/skip breakdown.
  Click any row to see the exact assertion error (for a failure) or the
  documented reason (for a skip).

## Receiver hosting

This project's receiver is deployed permanently on Render rather than run
through a local tunnel — Cloudflare's free "quick tunnels" hand out a random
URL on every restart with no way to keep it stable, and the underlying
connection isn't reliable long-term (observed dying silently overnight). A
deployed receiver means the CometChat Dashboard's webhook URL is configured
**once**, permanently.

One consequence: since tests run from a developer's machine but the receiver
runs elsewhere, the receiver can't read `reports/json/results.json` off a
filesystem it doesn't share. `scripts/upload-test-results.ts` POSTs the
report to the receiver's `POST /test-results` endpoint instead — runs
automatically via `npm run test:webhooks`.

## Multiple environments

This suite can target different CometChat apps — a staging app and three
regional production apps — via `src/config/env.ts`, which loads
`.env.<APP_ENV>` instead of a single bare `.env`. Named `APP_ENV` rather than
a generic `TEST_ENV`, deliberately: Production alone spans 3 regions here
(`prod-us`/`prod-eu`/`prod-in`), so "prod" on its own isn't specific enough
to load real config from. `src/config/env.ts`'s exported `environment` field
(`"staging" | "prod"`) is still available for any code that only needs the
coarse distinction — see `prod.config.ts`/`staging.config.ts` for the
per-tier policy (valid regions, confirmation requirement) that key derives.

```bash
npm run test:staging                                  # APP_ENV=staging-us
npm run test:prod:eu                                   # APP_ENV=prod-eu, confirmed
# equivalent, if you need raw playwright flags (e.g. --grep):
APP_ENV=prod-eu CONFIRM_PROD=yes npx playwright test --grep group
```

`APP_ENV` must be one of `staging-us`, `prod-us`, `prod-eu`, `prod-in`. Any
`prod-*` target is refused unless `CONFIRM_PROD=yes` is also set — this
suite creates/deletes groups, sends messages, and bans/blocks users, so a
stray or forgotten `APP_ENV` should never silently run against a real
production app. Every run prints a banner (`Environment: PROD`, `APP_ENV:
prod-eu`, app ID, region) before a single test executes.

**Set up a new environment**:
1. `cp .env.example .env.<name>` and fill in that app's App ID, Region, and REST API Key
2. Deploy a **separate, dedicated** Render receiver for it (don't share one
   across environments — keeps prod and staging fully isolated). Same steps
   as "Step 1" above, just a new Render Web Service from the same repo.
3. Fill in that receiver's URL as `WEBHOOK_RECEIVER_URL`/`RECEIVER_QUERY_URL`
   in the new `.env.<name>` file
4. `APP_ENV=<name> npm run setup` — creates `qa-user-1`/`qa-user-2` on that app
5. Add a **new, separate** webhook on that app in the Dashboard (Step 2 above)
   pointing at the new receiver — never repoint an existing webhook that
   might already drive real business logic on a prod app

## Webhook coverage registry & report

`src/registry/webhook.registry.ts` aggregates one file per category
(`group.registry.ts`, `message.registry.ts`, `user.registry.ts`,
`moderation.registry.ts`, `calls.registry.ts`, `meetings.registry.ts`,
`campaign.registry.ts`) — 51 webhooks total. Each entry carries its category,
what actually triggers it, the automation method (REST/SDK/none), the real
payload fields a passing test asserts on, and a status:

- **AUTOMATED** — a real test exists and asserts on a real, live-verified payload
- **NOT_IMPLEMENTED** — believed achievable with what's already available, just not built yet (with a reason)
- **BLOCKED** — genuinely can't be triggered with what's currently available — missing product module/credentials, or a Dashboard-only human action with no API equivalent (with a reason)

`scripts/generate-coverage.ts` (wired into every `test:*` script, or run
standalone as `npm run coverage`) cross-references the registry against the
most recent local Playwright run for whichever environment actually produced
it — tagged via a run-provenance marker (`reports/json/.run-env.json`,
stamped by `playwright.config.ts` at the start of each run) rather than this
script's own environment resolution, specifically so a standalone `npm run
coverage` invocation can never mislabel a stale, different environment's
results (this happened once during development — see git history). It prints
a console report and writes/updates:
- `reports/coverage/webhook-coverage.json` — accumulates one slice per environment, so running staging today and prod-eu tomorrow builds a combined multi-environment picture rather than overwriting each other
- `reports/coverage/webhook-coverage.md` — the same data as a table

**Current coverage (last run, prod-eu, 2026-09-04): 24 AUTOMATED (all pass), 2 NOT_IMPLEMENTED, 25 BLOCKED, 51 total.**

**Adding a new webhook**:
1. Add one entry to the relevant `src/registry/<category>.registry.ts` (`id`, `trigger`, `expectedEvent`, `automationMethod`, `expectedPayloadKeys`, and either `status: 'AUTOMATED'` with `specFile`/`testTitleMatch` pointing at a real test, or `status: 'BLOCKED'`/`'NOT_IMPLEMENTED'` with a `reason`)
2. If it needs a new way to reach CometChat, add it to the relevant `src/clients/*.client.ts`
3. Add (or extend) a trigger function in `src/triggers/<category>/<category>.triggers.ts`
4. Add a validator function in `src/validators/<category>.validator.ts`
5. Add a JSON schema entry in `schemas/<category>/` once you've captured a real payload (optional, but keep it real — no invented shapes)
6. Add the spec file under `src/tests/<category>/`
7. Run it, confirm it passes for real, then `npm run coverage` to update the report

Nothing else needs to change — every layer above reads from the registry or from what the previous layer produced.

## Known limitations

Not every CometChat webhook trigger can be exercised by REST alone.
`group_member_joined`/`left`, delivery/read receipts, the group-only
aggregate receipts (`message_delivered_to_all`/`message_read_by_all`), and
connection status only fire from a real, connected SDK client (WebSocket) —
`src/clients/sdk.client.ts` covers these for real by driving the actual
CometChat JS SDK inside a Playwright-controlled browser, logged in via a
server-generated Auth Token. Not a mock — a real client session.

What's still genuinely out of reach, documented as explicit, reasoned gaps
(not silently omitted) so they stay visible — see the registry files for the
authoritative, per-webhook version of this:

| Trigger(s) | Why it's blocked | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webhook create/update/enable/disable/delete, add/remove trigger | Needs a Multi-Tenancy Management API key (`COMETCHAT_MGMT_KEY`/`SECRET`) from CometChat Sales — the per-app REST key 404s against `apimgmt.cometchat.io` | `src/tests/_shared/webhook-configuration.spec.ts` (not part of the 51-webhook registry — this is CRUD on webhook *configuration*, not a webhook event itself) |
| Calls (9), Meetings (5) | No Calls SDK integration exists, and it's unconfirmed the add-on is even enabled on any of the 4 apps. A mocked/simulated call session would violate "never fake a PASS" | `src/registry/calls.registry.ts`, `meetings.registry.ts` |
| Campaign/Notification events (10) | No Campaigns module integration exists, same unconfirmed-add-on situation | `src/registry/campaign.registry.ts` |
| `moderation_engine_blocked`, `moderation_engine_approved` | See "Moderation" below — the trigger condition this project previously relied on no longer reproduces; most likely the Moderation webhook trigger category just isn't checked in the Dashboard, same pattern found for Group triggers | `src/registry/moderation.registry.ts` |
| `moderation_manual_approved` | Dashboard-only human action (an admin manually approving flagged content) — no REST/SDK equivalent exists | `src/registry/moderation.registry.ts` |

## CometChat's built-in Moderation Engine

If your app has Moderation enabled (Dashboard → your app → Moderation), be
aware it can silently block test messages before any `message_sent` webhook
fires — observed live (pre-2026-09-03, prod-eu): a raw 10+ digit timestamp
embedded in message text got pattern-matched as a phone number ("Contact
details filter"), and a single character repeated thousands of times read as
spam. This suite avoids both — see `timestampToken()`/`fillerText()` in
`src/data/factories/message.factory.ts` — but flood/rate-style rules can
still produce inconsistent false positives on otherwise-safe traffic under
rapid, repeated test runs.

**Update, 2026-09-04**: re-probed live against prod-eu with the same
phone-pattern text that previously triggered a block (`src/clients/moderation.client.ts`'s
`sendPhonePatternMessage`) — it now sends cleanly as `message_sent`, not
`moderation_engine_blocked`. The message's own metadata shows a moderation
extension did run (`metadata['@injected'].extensions['human-moderation'].success: true`),
but no moderation **webhook** fired either way. Most likely, based on this
project's prior experience with Group triggers (a category can show "on"
while individual trigger checkboxes are unchecked): the Moderation trigger
category needs to be explicitly enabled in the webhook's trigger
configuration. Needs a Dashboard check — see `src/registry/moderation.registry.ts`.

## `scripts/register-webhooks.ts`

Automates the manual Dashboard step in Step 2, once you have real
`COMETCHAT_MGMT_KEY`/`COMETCHAT_MGMT_SECRET` from CometChat Sales. Fails fast
with a clear message if they're not set. See the file's header comment for
details (its exact endpoint paths are transcribed from docs, not
live-verified, since this project has never had Management API credentials
to test against).

## Notes

- The receiver keeps two stores: an in-memory one (`events`) that tests reset
  between specs for isolation, and a disk-persisted one (`history`, in
  `receiver/data/events-history.json`) that the dashboard reads and that
  survives restarts. `DELETE /webhook/events` clears only the former;
  `DELETE /webhook/history` clears the latter.
- Webhooks are asynchronous — `src/webhook/webhook.waiter.ts`'s polling
  helpers retry for a few seconds before failing with a debuggable timeout
  error listing what *did* arrive in that window, rather than a bare "timed out".
- Every test's created resources are torn down via `src/utils/cleanup.ts`'s
  per-test registry (`registerCleanup(...)` + a shared `afterEach`) — safe as
  a module-level stack specifically because this suite runs serially
  (`playwright.config.ts`: `fullyParallel: false, workers: 1`).
- Swap the in-memory/JSON-file receiver storage for Redis/Postgres before
  using this as permanent shared CI infrastructure with concurrent runs.
