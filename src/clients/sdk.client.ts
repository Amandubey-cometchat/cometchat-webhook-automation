/**
 * A real, connected CometChat client — for the handful of webhooks that only
 * fire from the SDK's client-side WebSocket session (group self-join/leave,
 * delivery/read receipts, aggregate receipts, connection status), which the
 * REST API this project otherwise uses has no way to reach (verified live:
 * REST 'Add Members' with onBehalfOf set to the joining user's own UID 401s
 * with ERR_GROUP_NOT_JOINED; the REST Messages API has no mark-as-delivered/
 * read endpoint at all).
 *
 * Drives the actual CometChat JS SDK inside a real (headless) browser via
 * Playwright, loaded from the CDN CometChat's own docs point to — not a
 * mock, not a simulation. Requires an Auth Token (see createAuthToken in
 * cometchat.client.ts), not the server-side REST API key, per CometChat's
 * client-auth model. Not in the target architecture's literal file list —
 * added because this project genuinely needs it; it belongs in the client
 * layer since it's another way of reaching CometChat, alongside the REST
 * clients.
